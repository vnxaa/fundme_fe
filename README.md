# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
npm install
npx hardhat node 
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network hardhat
npx hardhat run scripts/NFT.js --network hardhat
npm i react-responsive-carousel
npm i web3
npm run dev
